    <p>Techmarines are Space Marines that have been
      inducted into the secrets of the Machine Cult. They
      can use this Special Ability any time a friendly Heavy
      Vehicle up to 3 squares away (or the vehicle transporting the
      Techmarine) suffers a Hit if the Techmarine has not already
      been activated this turn and it does not have any Suppressed
      Markers on it. When your opponent rolls to determine which
      Damage your Heavy Vehicle receives, you may force him to roll
      1 additional die and choose which result will be applied.</p>
    <p>If you use this ability, you must place an Activated Marker on
      the Techmarine Unit and discard any Order Token on it.</p>
