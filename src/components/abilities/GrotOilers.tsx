    <p>If a Unit uses the Mekaniak Special Ability while it is in
      the ZoC of an unactivated Grot Oiler, it may increase or
      reduce the result of the Damage location roll by 1 or 2
      points. If you use this ability, you must place an Activated Marker
      on the Grot Oiler Unit and discard any Order Token on it.</p>
