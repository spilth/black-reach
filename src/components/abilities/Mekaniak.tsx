    <p>Ork Mekaniaks have an uncanny ability to keep their
      Vehicles and machines operating, though no one can
      seem to figure out how they do it. They can use this
      Special Ability any time a friendly Heavy Vehicle up to 3 squares
      away (or the vehicle transporting the Mekaniak) suffers a Hit if
      the Mekaniak has not already been activated this turn a n d it
      does not have any Suppressed Markers on it. When your opponent
      rolls to determine which Damage your Heavy Vehicle receives,
      you can increase or reduce the result by 1, after the die is rolled
      If you use this ability, you must place an Activated Marker on the
      Mekaniak Unit and discard any Order Token on it.</p>
