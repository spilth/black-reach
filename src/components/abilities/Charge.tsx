    <p>When this Unit launches an Assault, it may make a free
      attack before resolving the Assault. Move the Unit next
      to the target, then resolve the attack as you would a
      Firing Action (but it is not a Firing Action). The target receives
      any Defensive Bonuses from the Terrain Element. If the target
      survives, resolve the Assault.</p>
    <p>This free attack ignores any range restrictions.</p>
    <p>If the target is Destroyed, the Unit must end its Movement Action
      in the square the target was in before the attack.
      This Special Ability may be combined with the Fire on the Move
      Special Ability.</p>
